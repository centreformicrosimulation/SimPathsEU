* DESCRIPTION:         	Sets out the assumptions and conditions imposed in the

*   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
*    Assumptions imposed to align the SILC data with simulation rules:
*   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*   - Retirement:
*       - Treated as an absorbing state
*       - Must retire by a specified maximum age
*       - Cannot retire before a specified minimum age
*
*   - Education:
*       - Leave education no earlier than a specified minimum age
*       - Must leave the initial education spell by a specified maximum age
*       - Cannot return to education after retirement
*
*   - Work:
*       - Can work from a specified minimum age
*       - Activity status and hours of work populated consistently:
*           → Assume not working if report hours = 0 
*           → Assume hours = 0 if not working
* 		- If missing partial information, don't assume the missing is 0 and 
* 			impute (hot-deck)
*
*   - Leaving the parental home:
*       - Can leave from a specified minimum age
* 		- Become the effective head of hh even when living with parents when 
* 			paretns retire or reach state retirment age
*
*   - Home ownership:
*       - Can own a home from a specified minimum age
*
*   - Partnership formation:
*       - Can form a partnership from a specified minimum age
*
*   - Disability:
*       - Treated as a subsample of the not-employed population
*
*   The relevant age thresholds are defined in globals defined in "DEFINE 
* 	PARAMETERS" section below. 
* 	Throughout also construct relevant flags and produce a log file 
* 	"flag_descriptives.xlsx" to see the extent of the adjustments to the raw 
* 	data. 
*
*   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
*    Additional notes on implementation: 
*   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*   - Impute health score (generalized ordered logit model).
*   - Constructing age is not straight forward as not directly reported in the 
* 	  data, therefore: 
*       → Use interview age (RX010) where available
*       → Otherwise use age at end of interview year (PX020). This results in 
* 			upward bias of age.
*   - Set education = 0 (na) while in initial education spell. 
*
*   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
*   Remaining disparities between initial populations and simulation rules:
*   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*   - Ages at which females can have a child. [Be informed by the sample?]
*	  Permit teenage mothers in this script (deal with in 03_ )
*   - A few higher/older education spells (30+) that last multiple years 
*     in the simulation can only return to education for single year spells. 
* 	- Number of children vars (all ages or 0-2) don't account for feasibility 
* 		of age at birth of the mother.

/*
The thresholds defined below ensure consistency between the assumptions 
applied in the simulation and the structure of the initial population data. 
They specify the ages at which certain life-course transitions are permitted 
or enforced within the model. These limits reflect both modelling conventions 
and empirical considerations drawn from observed data.
