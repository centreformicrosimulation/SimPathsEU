Dataset quirks: the original variable that identifies an individual's

identifier (upid) for all individuals in this cumulative longitudional dataset, 
and as a result rb240 may no longer be unique and does not match-up with upid 
(required for future merging). As upid is simply a combination of urtgrp 
(a variable made by GESIS that identifies the rotational group and dropout year 
an individual belongs to) and the original unique personal identifier (rb030) it 
is possible to update rb240 to be consistent with GESIS's new unique personal 
identifier. Thus, I combine urtgrp and rb240 to ensure idpartner aligns with 
upid and do the same for idfather and idmother. 

Note on the variable: rb240 includes married people and partners in a 
consensual union (with or without a legal basis).

/******************************* AGE ******************************************/ 
/* 
EU-SILC has a number of possible variables that could be used to create age. 
Age at end of inc ref period (px020), age at the time of the interview (rx010), 
as well as year of birth (rb080). 

The choice implies depends on the number of missing values and when you want to 
measure age. 
- px020 Age at the beginning of the calender year of the interview 
- rb080 Age at the end of the calender year of the interview 
- rx010 Age at the interview

Choice will impact the age at which we have information about personal data 
variables and how we deal with new borns. 

If born in the current year and use age at the beginning of the year will get 
individuals with age = -1.
If use age at the end of the calender year, don't get any information for 
individuals with stated age of 16. 

Note that most personal interviews occur in the second quarter of the calender 
year for PL. 

Note that looks like to have a personal interview have to be 16 at the end of 
the previous calender as when rx010 == 16 & px020 is missig so are all fo the 
activity variable. Min(px020) = 16. 

This suggests it is prefereable to use variable rx010 where possible and then 
allow for an upward bias by using the age at the end of the calender year as the 
back up when rx010 is not available. 

Also note that age is top coded at 78.We address this by imposing longitudinal 
consistency for those observed turning 78 within their individual panel. For 
those who are at least 78 across in all of thier observations, we impute age 
randomly drawing from a gender-specific log-normal distribution, with parameters 
informed by SHARE data. Longitudinal consistency is also imposed in these 
cases.

Consensual union with a legal basis includes both married couples and registered

Both modalities have to live in the same household in both instances.  
From my understanding, this includes same sex couples.

A key difference here appears to be that income in EU-SILC is yearly, whereas

and therefore actually is more relevant for the previous year. 

Note that for wages there is an inconsistency. Details about the adjustment 
below.

*/
/*************** GROSS PERSONAL NON-BENEFIT MONTHLY INCOME ********************/
/* 
UK version: egen ypnb = rowtotal(fimnlabgrs_dv fimnpen_dv fimnmisc_dv ///
	inc_stp inc_tu inc_ma); 
inc_stp, inc_tu and inc_ma generated at the beginning from income file

1 - fimnlabgrs_dv: 	total personal monthly labour income gross: employee 
						cash or near cash income (gross). 
						
DP: Note that in UKHLS the variable fimnlabgrs_dv  contains “labour income” 
(see here: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/...
mainstage/variables/fihhmnlabgrs_dv/_) 
so my understanding is that self-employment income should also be included here. 
SILC also has a variable py020g – fringe benefits – currently not included here 
(neither inlcuded in the EUROMOD definition of original income)  

EU-SILC version: 

py010g py050g py020g
					
py010g :  	Employee cash or near cash income 
py050g :	Cash benefits or losses from self-employment 
py020g : 	Non-cash employee income [Omitted]

These variables correspond to a the previous calender year. 

2 - fimnpen_dv: 	Monthly amount of net pension income		

DP: The Usoc description says that this variable includes receipts reported in 
the income data file where w_ficode equals [2] pension from a previous employer,
or [3]  pension from a spouse’s previous employer.  
This is assumed to be reported net of tax. So in the UK these are occupational 
pensions.  
I think it is correct to use py080g in SILC as an equivalent. 
EU-SILC version: 

py080g 
												
py080g: 	Pension from individual	private	plans	

3 - fimnmisc_dv: 	monthly amount of net miscellaneous income

DP: The Usoc description says this includes receipts reported in the income data 
file where w_ficode equals 
-  educational grant (not student loan or tuition fee loan), 
-  payments from a family member not living here, or 
-  any other regular payment (not asked in Wave 1). This is assumed to be 
	reported net of tax. 

During our last discussion it became clear that this variable was meaning to 
approximate EUROMOD market income, which does not include scholarships 
(they are considered as benefits) ==> 
==> they have to be removed from the market income in the UK as well.   

4 -  "inc_stp" "inc_tu" "inc_ma" are generated in the UK  do-file called 
"01_prepare_ukhls_pooled_data" 
gen inc_stp = frmnthimp_dv if ficode == 1 (NI Retirement/State Retirement 
(Old Age) Pension) ==> the decision was not to include state pensions  

gen inc_tu = frmnthimp_dv if ficode == 25 (Trade Union / 
Friendly Society Payment)

gen inc_ma = frmnthimp_dv if ficode == 26 (Maintenance or Alimony)

EU SILC variables: 

hy080g hy081g hy110g hy040g hy090g

hy080g: 	Regular interhousehold cash transfer received
hy081g: 	Alimony and maintenance payments 
hy110g: 	Income received by people aged under 16
hy040g: 	Income frm rental of a property or land 
hy090g: 	Intrst, div, prof frm cptl inv in uncorp bsn

DP: Household level variables so should  be split equally among all adults. 
Could be attributed to individuals by splitting it among all eligible children 
in relation to child income.  (in EUROMOD these types of incomes are split 
between the oldest couple in the household).

/***************************** WEIGHTS ****************************************/
/*
Clare's notes: 
The EU-SILC panel contains a series of weights to ensure the sample is 
representative. 
The documentation (Eurostat, 2015) and Verma (2006) discuss how these weights 
are calculated. 
Unfortunately, for this cumulative longitudinal dataset created by GESIS, the 
original weights are no longer appropriate. 
However, GESIS discusses how to rescale two of the weights (RB060: individual 
base weight & RB064: individual longitudinal weight)

1. RB060, the so-called "modified base-weight". 
Each observation in the EU-SILC data set (R file) comes with this weight. 
In the first year of observation it equals the design weight, calibrated and 
modified to take non-responses into account. The base-weight of the years that 
follow is given by the previous year's base-weight adjusted for non-response 
rates.

2. RB064, the longitudinal weights.  
Created to be used with datasets made up of one rotational group covering four 
years (within a given release). 
They are built with the intent of making sure that this sub-sample is 
representative of the longitudinal population of the year in which the 
rotational group had been surveyed for the first time. 
RB064 is reported only during the last year of a rotational group covering four 
years. It is constant with respect to the year of observation, but varies across 
individuals. 
Since both weights are built based on single rotational groups, they can be used 
to calculate weights for a larger, cumulative sample. 

RB060 can be simply rescaled. The same goes for RB064, but in this case, one 
must restrict the merged sample to rotational groups that cover 4 years, which 
leads to loss of data. 
Also, RB064 makes sure that the sample is representative with respect to the 
longitudinal population of the year in which the rotational group was first 
surveyed. 
This means that the final result becomes something resembling a "moving sample", 
a set of sub-samples representative of different longitudinal populations. 
In practice, even though RB064 and RB060 take on very different values in some 
cases, on average, the difference is not much.

More information on the rescaling of rb060 and rb064 can be found in the GESIS 
documentation (Marwin Borst & Heike Wirth, EU-SILC Tools: eusilcpanel_2020 
First computational steps towards a cumulative sample based on the EU-SILC 
longitudinal datasets - update. GESIS Papers 2022|10)

/*
DP: We decided to use Individual Cross-sectional Weight rescaled weight, RB060, 
for the initial populations. As can be seen below the popuatlion numbers closely
align with the totals of the resclaed RB060 but not with the rescaled RB062. 
For the regression estimates ==> either RB060 or RB062 or RB064 can be used, or 
no weights at all.

/* 
RB060 - Individual Cross-sectional Weight 

The RB060 weight is referred to as the "modified base-weight" in EU-SILC. It is 
designed to ensure that observations are representative of the sample for a 
specific year and country. 

1/ In the first year of observation, RB060 is equivalent to the design weight. 
This design weight is calibrated and adjusted for non-response rates.
2/ In the following years, RB060 is adjusted based on non-response rates in the 
subsequent waves of the survey. This ensures that the weight reflects the 
participation of individuals over time.
3/ Rescaling Process: When combining multiple waves or rotational groups 
(which cover multiple years), you need to rescale RB060 by multiplying it by a 
scaling factor (rscale) that accounts for the relative size of each rotational 
group compared to the total sample. This helps maintain proportionality across t
he cumulative dataset.

The steps for rescaling RB060:
1. Sort data by rotation group and year 
2. Calculate the sum of RB060 for each rotation group within each year
3. Calculate the total RB060 for each year 
4. Rescale the RB060 weights

This scaling ensures that each rotation group contributes appropriately to the 
overall sample, and helps prevent over-representation or under-representation of
specific groups.

DB075 - Rotation Group  
"This variable must be filled only for the countries using a rotational design.
Rotational design: Refers to any sample selection which is based on a fixed 
number of sub-samples, called replications, each one representative of the 
target population at the time of their selection. 
Each year, one sub-sample rotates out and a new one is drawn as a substitute. 
In the case of a rotational design based on four replications with a rotation of
one replication per year, one of the replications must be dropped immediately 
after the first year, the second must be retained for 2 years, the third for 3 
years, and the fourth for 4 years. 
From the second year onwards, at the start of each new year one replication must 
be introduced and retained for 4 years.
Rotation group: Each replication is called a rotational group and the 
information on the group to which the household belongs is especially useful for
controlling the implementation of the sample over time. 
Regarding the numbering of the rotation groups over time, it is recommended that 
each rotation group keeps the same number throughout the period of the survey."

/*
The GESIS documentation paper suggests how to rescale RB064 
(four-year duration weight) : 
The same rescaling logic applies to RB064 with a minor tweak: RB064 is
reported only in the last year of panel covering four years. So, the first step 
is to copy RB064 to all years of all rotational groups that come with RB064. 
Second, analysts should drop all observations with RB064s missing to make sure 
that only rotational groups covering four years are in the sample.

Since we estimate models with one lag max I tried to use RB062 
(two-year duration weight) instead of RB064
