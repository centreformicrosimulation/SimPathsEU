# DSGE Policy Function Export for SimPaths

**Model:** Macromodel_Poland_frozen

## 1. State-Space Representation

The linearized DSGE solution separates **state** (predetermined) and **jump** (forward-looking) variables:

```
s_t = A  * s_{t-1} + B_s * ε_t    (state transition)
y_t = C  * s_{t-1} + D   * ε_t    (jump variables)
```

Where:
- `s_t` = state variables (13×1): predetermined, depend on lagged values
- `y_t` = jump variables (9×1): forward-looking, determined by expectations
- `A`   = state transition matrix (13 × 13)
- `B_s` = shock impact on states (13 × 8)
- `C`   = jump response to lagged states (9 × 13)
- `D`   = jump response to shocks (9 × 8)
- `ε_t` = shock innovations (8×1)

**Key insight for SimPaths:**
- Wage `w` is a **state variable** → extract from `s_t` directly
- Inflation `π` is **also a state variable** since V15 (inflation
  indexation puts `pi(-1)` in the NKPC) → extract from `s_t`, NOT `y_t`
- eps_L/eps_h inputs are **percent log-deviations** (100 × ln ratio);
  a +5% labour-force deviation is eps_L ≈ 4.879, not 0.05

### Ramsey trend handoff

The files above are the DSGE half of the bundle. The Ramsey trend layer
consumes these, and **SimPaths must read them rather than re-derive them**.
Every path here is produced on the MATLAB side; a second implementation
downstream is how the two sides drift apart without any error surfacing.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `growth_model_reference_poland.csv` | In-sample Ramsey solution; its last row is the handoff quarter that every other file aligns to |
| `growth_params_Poland.json` | Calibrated structural parameters and solver settings |
| `growth_terminal_state.json` | Terminal K and A, the handoff quarter, and `projection_quarters` (the forward horizon; a mismatch silently changes the terminal closure) |
| `population_projection_Poland.csv` | SimPaths-consistent demographic path, `time,N` (`time,N,WAP` in endogenous mode) |
| `hours_projection_Poland.csv` | Planner hours per worker, `time,h`, `projection_quarters + 1` rows from the handoff |

**Alignment.** Each projection is located by DATE, not by row position: find the
row whose label equals the handoff quarter and read forward from there. A
projection may legitimately begin earlier than the handoff.

**Hours.** `hours_projection_*.csv` exists because SimPaths used to extend the
reference CSV's `h` column itself, with a different trailing-growth window (20)
than this side uses (1). That divergence was invisible only because
`hours_trend_method` is `log_linear`, which makes `h` a pure exponential so every
window recovers the same rate. Do not reintroduce a local fallback: a missing
file must fail the run.

**What is still built on both sides.** The terminal tail appended past the
SimPaths horizon is not exported. Both sides construct it with the same rule
(trailing-growth window 20 for the demographic path, 1 for hours), enforced only
by convention and a downstream tripwire test.

## 5. Key IRF: Labor Force Shock (eps_L)

This is the primary interface with SimPaths:
- SimPaths sends labor force change (ΔL)
- DSGE returns wage response (Δw), employment (Δn), inflation (Δπ)

See `irfs_eps_L.csv` for the full impulse response.

## 6. Usage Notes

1. **Units:** All variables are in % deviations from steady state
2. **Frequency:** Quarterly (DSGEModel.java runs 4 quarters and averages for annual)
3. **Causality:** Two-way coupling:
   - SimPaths → DSGE: Labor force change (ΔL) as shock
   - DSGE → SimPaths: Wage (Δw) and inflation (Δπ) feedback
4. **Steady state:** All zeros (log-linearized model)
5. **Indexing:** JSON uses 1-based (MATLAB), Java code uses 0-based
