NUTS 1 Region Italy

There is a NUTS1 region border change during the SILC panel, however its impact is minimal therefore leave regions are reported.  Simply recode the regions so the coding is consistent across the panel. 

	ITD -> ITH  
	ITE -> ITI 

	3 = Northwest 
	6 = South 
	7 = Islands
	8 = Northeast 
	9 = Central 



“"Similarly, the old ITD5 region (Emilia-Romagna) has a correspondence with the 
new ITH5 region with the same name. The only difference between ITD5 and ITH5 
lies in that its ninth NUTS 3 region, ITD59 (Rimini), experienced a boundary 
shift, being transformed into the bigger ITH59 (Rimini). This boundary shift is 
in turn compensated by the complementary reduction in the old ITE31 (Pessaro e 
Urbino), which was part of the old NUTS 2 ITE3 (Marche), which are converted 
into the new ITI31 (Pessaro e Urbino) and ITI3 (Marche) respectively."
