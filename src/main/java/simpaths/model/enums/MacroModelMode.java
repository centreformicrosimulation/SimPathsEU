 * Which layers of the macro module run, selected by the {@code mm_macroModel} config key.
 *
 * <p>The module has two layers that are independently switchable: the Ramsey growth model,
 * which supplies the secular wage trend, and the DSGE, which supplies the business cycle
 * around it. This enum replaces the three booleans {@code mm_useMacroModel},
 * {@code mm_useRamseyTrend} and {@code mm_useDSGE}, whose eight combinations expressed only
 * these four states.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #DSGE} is a diagnostic configuration, not a production one. The DSGE is estimated
 * on Ramsey-detrended observables and its steady state is the Ramsey path by construction, so
 * without the trend layer the cycle deviates around SimPaths' own wage-growth trend rather
 * than around the trend that identified it.</p>
