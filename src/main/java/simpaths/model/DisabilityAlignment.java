/**
 * DisabilityAlignment adjusts the probability of becoming disabled.
 * The object is designed to assist modification of the intercept of the "H2" disability model.
 *
 * A search routine is used to find the value by which the intercept should be adjusted.
 * If the projected share of disabled individuals in the population differs from the desired target by more than a specified threshold,
 * then the intercept is adjusted and the share re-evaluated.
 *
 * Importantly, the adjustment needs to be only found once. Modified intercepts can then be used in subsequent simulations.
